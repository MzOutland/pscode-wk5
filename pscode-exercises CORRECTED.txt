// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
(Your pseudocode here)
	//IF num1 + num2 = sum 
		//print("The number is even") 
		//else: print("The number is odd.")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
(Your pseudocode here)

// Type "Enter 5 numbers" 
//Enter N1,N2,N3,N4,N5 
	// PRINT ("The Average Is")
	//Calculate AVG to (N1+N2+N3+N4+N5)/5 
		//AVG IF(N1 < N2) 
		//Set MAX to N2 
		//Else Set MAX to N1 IF(N3 > MAX)
		//Set MAX to N3 IF(N4 > MAX)
		//Set MAX to N4 IF(N5 > MAX)
			//Set MAX to N5 
//PRINT ("The MAX is")
	//PRINT MAX IF(N1 > N2) 
//Set MIN to N2 Else Set MIN to N1 IF(N3 < MIN)
//Set MIN to N3 IF(N4 < MIN)
//Set MIN to N4 IF (N5 < MIN)
//Set MIN to N5 
//PRINT ("THE MIN IS")
